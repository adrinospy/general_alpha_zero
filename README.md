## Overview

This project implements a game-playing agent based on the AlphaZero algorithm, inspired by the DeepMind paper ["Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815). The agent is designed to play games with itself and learn through reinforcement learning. The agent generates data based on modified MCTS tree search algorithm and trains itself on the generated data.

## Features

- Self-play: The agent plays games against itself to generate training data.
- Neural Network: Implements a neural network for the game-playing policy and value estimation.
- Reinforcement Learning: Utilizes reinforcement learning techniques for training the agent.
- Game Environment: Support for multiple game environments (TicTacToe, ConnectFour, etc.).
